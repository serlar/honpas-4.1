!! CHKDER checks the gradients of M functions of N variables.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    CHKDER checks the gradients of M nonlinear functions in N variables,
!    evaluated at a point X, for consistency with the functions themselves.
!
!    The user calls CHKDER twice, first with MODE = 1 and then with MODE = 2.
!
!    MODE = 1.
!      On input,
!        X contains the point of evaluation.
!      On output,
!        XP is set to a neighboring point.
!
!    Now the user must evaluate the function and gradients at X, and the
!    function at XP.  Then the function is called again:
!
!    MODE = 2.
!      On input,
!        FVEC contains the function values at X,
!        FJAC contains the function gradients at X.
!        FVECP contains the functions evaluated at XP.
!      On output,
!        ERR contains measures of correctness of the respective gradients.
!
!    The function does not perform reliably if cancellation or
!    rounding errors cause a severe loss of significance in the
!    evaluation of a function.  Therefore, none of the components
!    of X should be unusually small (in particular, zero) or any
!    other value which may cause loss of significance.

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) M, is the number of functions.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) N, is the number of variables.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) X(N), the point at which the jacobian is to be
!    evaluated.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) FVEC(M), is used only when MODE = 2.
!    In that case, it should contain the function values at X.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) FJAC(LDFJAC,N), an M by N array.  When MODE = 2,
!    FJAC(I,J) should contain the value of dF(I)/dX(J).
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) LDFJAC, the leading dimension of FJAC.
!    LDFJAC must be at least M.
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) XP(N), on output with MODE = 1, is a neighboring
!    point of X, at which the function is to be evaluated.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) FVECP(M), on input with MODE = 2, is the function
!    value at XP.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) MODE, should be set to 1 on the first call, and
!    2 on the second.
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) ERR(M).  On output when MODE = 2, ERR contains
!    measures of correctness of the respective gradients.  If there is no
!    severe loss of significance, then if ERR(I):
!      = 1.0D+00, the I-th gradient is correct,
!      = 0.0D+00, the I-th gradient is incorrect.
!      > 0.5D+00, the I-th gradient is probably correct.
!      < 0.5D+00, the I-th gradient is probably incorrect.
