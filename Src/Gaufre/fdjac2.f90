!! FDJAC2 estimates an M by N jacobian matrix using forward differences.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This function computes a forward-difference approximation
!    to the M by N jacobian matrix associated with a specified
!    problem of M functions in N variables.

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, external FCN, the name of the user-supplied subroutine which
!    calculates the functions.  The routine should have the form:
!      subroutine fcn ( m, n, x, fvec, iflag )
!      integer ( kind = 4 ) n
!      real ( kind = 8 ) fvec(m)
!      integer ( kind = 4 ) iflag
!      real ( kind = 8 ) x(n)
!
!    If IFLAG = 0 on input, then FCN is only being called to allow the user
!    to print out the current iterate.
!    If IFLAG = 1 on input, FCN should calculate the functions at X and
!    return this vector in FVEC.
!    To terminate the algorithm, FCN may set IFLAG negative on return.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) M, is the number of functions.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) N, is the number of variables.  
!    N must not exceed M.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) X(N), the point where the jacobian is evaluated.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) FVEC(M), the functions evaluated at X.
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) FJAC(LDFJAC,N), the M by N approximate
!    jacobian matrix.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) LDFJAC, the leading dimension of FJAC, 
!    which must not be less than M.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) IFLAG, is an error flag returned by FCN.  
!    If FCN returns a nonzero value of IFLAG, then this routine returns 
!    immediately to the calling program, with the value of IFLAG.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) EPSFCN, is used in determining a suitable
!    step length for the forward-difference approximation.  This approximation
!    assumes that the relative errors in the functions are of the order of
!    EPSFCN.  If EPSFCN is less than the machine precision, it is assumed that
!    the relative errors in the functions are of the order of the machine
!    precision.
