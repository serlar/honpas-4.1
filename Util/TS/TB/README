The tight-binding setup codes found in this directory has been
deprecated.

These codes were the pre-cursor for the *much* more elaborate
Python tool-box: sisl which may be found here:

   https://github.com/zerothi/sisl

Please do NOT use the Python codes in this directory.

Please USE the sisl toolbox instead.
