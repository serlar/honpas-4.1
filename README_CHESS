Minimal compilation and linking instructions for CheSS
======================================================

1) Download and unpack the latest release of CheSS from Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/chess
   More detailed instructions for this step are shipped together with CheSS.
   In the following we assume that your main installation directory is called <build-dir>.

2) In your arch.make file you should add the following (without the ""):
   FPPFLAGS: add "-DSIESTA__CHESS"
   LIBS: add "<build-dir>/install/lib/libCheSS-1.a"
         add "<build-dir>/install/lib/libfutile-1.a"
         add "<build-dir>/install/lib/libyaml.a"
   INCFLAGS: add "-I<build-dir>/install/include"

3) Compile SIESTA as usual.
   You can check whether the installation has been successful by running the CheSS test
   that you can find in the folder Tests.
