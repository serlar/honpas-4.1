These are examples of computation of the Magnetic Anisotropy Energy (MAE)
and other checks for two systems: a Pt dimer, and a FePt bulk structure.

Note that to run the tests automatically you have to move a specific directory
one level up in the hierarchy:

  mv offsite_SOC_FePt_xz ..
  cd ../offsite_SOC_FePt_xz
  make
